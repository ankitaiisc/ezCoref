Macau has been a contact point between East and West ever since Portuguese ships first arrived in the 16th century. As Gary Mei points out, the enclave was opened to the outside world more than 300 years before Hong Kong. During much of the Ming and Qing dynasties, when maritime trade was officially banned, Macau was the shipping hub for the\" Silk Road of the Sea, \" which extended as far as South Asia, Africa and Europe in one direction, and Japan, Southeast Asia and South America in the other. Says Mei :\" This is where the Jesuits established the first Western-type university in the Far East, while Chinese scholars such as Hong Xiuquan, Lin Zexu, Liang Qichao, Kang Youwei and Cheng Guanying spent time here absorbing Western learning. \" Macau emerged unscathed from WWII, and many of its original Portuguese-language documents have been preserved intact, providing an invaluable resource for research into cultural and religious exchanges between East and West. In recent years, these archives have attracted particular attention from Taiwan scholars, notes Mei, driven by interest in the history of East-West exchanges and the influence of maritime culture on their island Furthermore, Macau also serves as an academic and cultural key to the world of the Romance languages. As Mei explains, there are plenty of old Portuguese texts preserved in Macau, and the university has a sizeable contingent of Portuguese-speaking professors. Most of the territory 's 10,000-plus Macanese ( locally born Portuguese ) have elected to remain after the handover, and there are several cultural groups dedicated to the work of translating Portuguese literature and preserving Portuguese culture. \" Taiwanese who wish to study Portuguese do n't have to go to Europe, \" says Mei. \" It 's enough to come to Macau. \" Though it occupies a tiny spit of land, the former Portuguese colony is home to 12 museums of art and history, more than Hong Kong. \" As economic entities go, Macau is tiny, \" says Mei, \" but as a store of culture it 's huge. So do n't look down on the place. \""}
