The grades speak well about the kind of student you are and will also determine the chances of further studies. You can not do all things at one time. At time you need to decide what to do according to their importance. This is one good skill that you will be requiring even after graduation.  There are few tips to help you at college :  Just find the place where you will not be disturbed. Grab your reading material, note pad, pen and other necessities. Distraction is a biggest hurdle in focusing. You need to ask yourself what distracts you the most. Is it music from the neighbors, presence of someone at home, internet or anything else? Try to be aware of your weakest points and then stay away from them as much possible during your study time. The distraction may also include your friends and some other things. It is only you who can decide that what is best for you.  When you are ready for studying, then arrange the reading material and decide what things you need to study first. Put maximum time on your weak and major subjects. Set aside your minor ones for few hours as you know that these are comparatively less important than the majors.  Make a realistic study plan which you can follow and stick to it. There is no point of making all 8hr study schedule daily as you know that it 's not possible for you. Start the preparation at least 4 weeks before the exams.  While making a study plan, do n't forget the breaks after every 90minutes of study. It will help your eyes to relax and focus in an effective manner. Make a checklist of small milestones and put this on your table so you can see them frequently. When you are done with one or more cross them from the list and focus on the new ones."}
