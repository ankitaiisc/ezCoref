{"docid_partnum": ["mz/sinorama/10/ectb_1001", 3], "doc_string": "\" Semi-liberated area\" Perhaps the reason for the apparent lack of attachment to Taiwan among the many returned Taiwan alumni can be traced to historical factors. In 1966, Macau was convulsed by rioting in which several people were shot and killed by Portuguese security forces. The enclave 's left-wing groups, which were closely allied with Beijing, took advantage of the situation to get KMT organizations in Macau shut down and their people expelled. Ever since, Macau has been regarded in certain circles in Taiwan as a\" semi-liberated area. \" But if Macau 's pro-Beijing forces are that strong, how come so many students come to Taiwan to get their degrees? \" There are historical reasons for this too, \" says Ou Jinrong, former president of Macau 's Taiwan Alumni Association and a member both of the Macau SAR 's first Selection Committee, and its Preparatory Committee. Prior to the 1980s, Macau lacked its own colleges, and students had to go overseas for higher education. Also, colleges on the mainland did n't start enrolling overseas students until the mid-1980s, while it was difficult to gain admission to university in Hong Kong. Under these circumstances, Taiwanese universities, which actively recruited abroad, were a natural choice for many Macau students. \" In terms of the return you get on your investment, taking your degree in Taiwan is well worth it, \" says Wang Yun, acting head of the sanitation and environment division of Macau 's urban administration office, who graduated in civil engineering from National Cheng Kung University ( NCKU ) in Tainan. Taiwan 's universities have good teachers and decent facilities, says Wang, and students from Macau can learn much in Taiwan that will benefit them in their careers. Unlike the colonial administration in Hong Kong, the government of Macau under the Portuguese recognized academic credentials issued by Taiwanese institutions. It was only in the mid-1980s, once the timetable for the handover of Hong Kong and Macau had been agreed, that the government began to localize the civil service in preparation for the transition to\" Macau people running Macau. \" A number of graduates who had returned from Taiwan to work in the private sector then shifted to government jobs, and have come to form an influential part of the administration. \" Little prawns grow into big lobsters if there are no fish in the sea, \" smiles Leong Kam Chun, who graduated in business administration from NTU in 1973. Compared with the many Macau students who went to the mainland to study from the mid-1980s onwards, those who graduated in Taiwan returned and joined the civil service earlier, and seem to have made faster progress in their careers. \" There 's no denying that Taiwan universities have given us a good education, \" smiles Leong Hong Sai, secretary of Macau 's Taiwan Universities Alumni Association. In addition to the government officials who studied in Taiwan, many returned graduates have become influential in Macau through their success in the private sector. Leong Kam Chun, for instance, one of the territory 's first group of professional accountants, has also served on the legislative council and is a member of the Macau SAR Selection Committee. Leong Man Io, current president of the Taiwan Universities Alumni Association, who graduated in civil engineering from NCKU, is one of Macau 's most prominent civil engineers.
