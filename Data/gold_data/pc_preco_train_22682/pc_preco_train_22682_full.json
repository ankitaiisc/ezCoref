He usually buys new books on the Internet. But sometimes he is too busy and has no time to look for books he wants. So her daughter Lucy often helps him to buy books.  Mrs Green likes beautiful clothes. She always watches new skirts or dresses in clothes shops first and then buys some of them on the Internet. Of course, they are cheap. But sometimes she is because many other women wear the same clothes as her!  Lucy likes listening to music. She often buys CDs on the Internet. They are usually cheap. But the only problem is that some CDs sound a little bad.  Eric buys many things on the Internet, from school things to toys.
