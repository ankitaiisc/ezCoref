Office director William Li was subsequently reprimanded by the Mainland Affairs Council for his handling of the affair. None of the above was problems at the time of Hong Kong 's handover in 1997, which goes to show how cautious the Macau SAR government is regarding Taiwan. When senior Macau officials are asked about having studied in Taiwan, they are always quick to add mention of other academic qualifications obtained in Macau, Lisbon, or mainland China. \" It 's called sanitizing your record! \" quips Tan Zhiqiang, Hong Kong and Macau bureau chief for the China Times, who was born and raised in Macau and wrote his doctoral dissertation on\" The Question of Macau 's Sovereignty. \" The more senior a government official is, the more defensive he is likely to be on the subject of his studies in Taiwan. \" It does n't matter where you studied and where you graduated, \" says Chen Mingying, a senior official in the Macau government 's news department. Competence and professionalism are what the government requires from its personnel. Another graduate of a Taiwan institution declares bluntly that he only spent four years in Taiwan getting his degree, and the place had virtually no effect on him at all. Nevertheless, there has been a steady stream of students from Macau to Taiwan ever since 1955. According to statistics from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, around 6,000 have come in the past ten years, and Professor Wong Hon Keong of Macau University 's Macau Research Center says that 30% of middle school graduates in the territory have sat the overseas enrolment test for college in Taiwan. Around 600 candidates passed the test last year, and there are on average 1,600-2,000 students from Macau at university in Taiwan at any one time."}
