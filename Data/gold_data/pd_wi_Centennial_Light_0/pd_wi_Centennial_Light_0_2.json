It is at 4550 East Avenue, Livermore, California, and maintained by the Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department. The fire department claims that the bulb is at least 107 years old and has been turned off only a handful of times. Due to its longevity, the bulb has been noted by The Guinness Book of World Records, Ripley 's Believe It or Not! and General Electric. The Centennial Light is a four-watt, hand-blown, carbon-filament, common light bulb manufactured in Shelby, Ohio, by the Shelby Electric Company in the late 1890s ; many just like it still exist and can be found functioning. According to Zylpha Bernal Beck, the bulb was donated to the Fire Department by her father, Dennis Bernal in 1901. Bernal owned the Livermore Power and Water Company and donated the bulb to the fire station when he sold the company. That story has been supported by firefighter volunteers of that era. The bulb 's history is difficult to ascertain, although evidence suggests the bulb has hung in at least four locations. It was originally hung in 1901 in a hose cart house on L Street, then moved to a garage in downtown Livermore used by the fire and police departments. When the fire department consolidated, it was moved again to a newly constructed City Hall that housed the unified departments. Its unusual longevity was first noticed in 1972 by reporter Mike Dunstan. After weeks of interviewing people who had lived in Livermore all their lives, he wrote\" Light Bulb May Be World 's Oldest\" , published in the Tri-Valley Herald. The article came to the attention of Charles Kuralt of the TV program On the Road with Charles Kuralt. Kuralt contacted Guinness Book of World Records, Ripley 's Believe It or Not, and General Electric who all confirmed it as the longest-lasting bulb known in existence. In 1976, the fire department moved to Fire Station # 6 with the bulb ; the bulb 's cord was severed for fear that unscrewing it could damage it. It was deprived of electricity for only 22 minutes during the transfer, which was made in a specially designed box and with full firetruck escort. An electrician was on hand to install the bulb into the new fire station 's emergency generator. Ripley 's Believe It Or Not stated that the short delay would not mar the bulb 's continuous burning record. In 2001, the bulb 's 100th birthday was celebrated with a community barbecue and live music. As of 2006, the bulb has been continuously lit for 30 years. The bulb is cared for by the Centennial Light Bulb Committee, a partnership of the Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department, Livermore Heritage Guild, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, and Sandia National Laboratories. The Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department plans to house and maintain the bulb for the rest of its life, regardless of length. When it does go out, they have no plans for it. Ripley 's Believe it or Not! has requested it for their museum. The bulb 's long life has been attributed to its low power, near continuous operation, and dedicated power supply. The bulb was officially listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as\" the Most Durable Light\" , in 1972, replacing another bulb in Fort Worth, Texas. The bulb was listed in the book for the next 16 editions. It was not listed during 1988 2006, without a reason being given, before returning in 2007. According to the fire chief, every few months a news outlet will publish a story on the bulb, generating visitors and general interest, then it will drop back into obscurity for a while. Dozens of magazines and newspapers have featured articles on the bulb. The bulb has been visited and featured by many major news channels in the United States, including NBC, ABC, FOX, CBS, WB, CNN and NPR. The bulb has received letters acknowledging and celebrating its longevity from the city of Shelby, Ohio, the Alameda County Board of Supervisors, the California State Assembly, the California State Senate, Congresswoman Ellen Tauscher, Senator Barbara Boxer, and President George W. Bush. The bulb was featured on an episode of MythBusters on December 13, 2006. It was also in the PBS documentary Livermore. On May 24, 2007, the bulb was Steve Wright 's featured webcam of the day on the BBC 's Radio 2 website. The bulb has its own website, and can be continuously viewed, by webcam, over the Internet. The site is maintained by the Centennial Light Bulb Committee, a partnership of the Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department, Livermore Heritage Guild, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, and Sandia National Laboratories. The Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department welcomes visitors to come and see the bulb, but makes no guarantee that officers will be on duty to let them in ; if officers are unavailable, visitors are encouraged simply to view it through the window. The bulb recently was mentioned on the Opie and Anthony Show as part of a Jim Norton bit. Coordinates : 37 40 49 N 121 44 21 W / 37.68028, -121.73917"}
