School policies vary as much as temps When is it too cold for schoolchildren to go outside for recess? The answer varies widely based on where a school is located and what the kids are used to.  Consider : One northern Minnesota school says it has to be 15 below zero before kids are kept inside. But in areas along the East Coast, temperatures below 35 to 40 degrees could keep kids inside. Canceling recess because of the cold is no small issue considering that much of the USA is trembling through what may be its coldest winter in a generation, according to AccuWeather.  There is no national temperature standard for when to keep kids inside during the winter months, the U.S. Department of Education says. Decisions are made at the local level, either by principals or school districts.  Consequently, policies are all over the map :  In International Falls, Minn., the self-described `` Icebox of the Nation, '' where the average high temperature in January is 13 degrees, Falls Elementary School Principal Jerry Hilfer says, `` if it 's 15 below ( or warmer ), they go out, no matter what. '' `` At 20 below, it gets iffy, '' he adds.  In Wicomico County, Md., principals typically keep children indoors when temperatures drop below freezing, or if it 's raining or snowing, says Susan Jones, the school system 's director of elementary education.  `` That 's the bottom line, '' says Curtis Twilley, principal of Pemberton Elementary School in Salisbury, Md. Twilley says students get little exercise when recess stays indoors. At Pemberton Elementary, the students will typically play board games or computer games in a classroom because the school 's gym is occupied with other classes, he says.  For schools in Marquette, Mich., which averages about 12 feet of snow per season, school officials acknowledge students are probably a little more prepared than those in some more mild climates."}
