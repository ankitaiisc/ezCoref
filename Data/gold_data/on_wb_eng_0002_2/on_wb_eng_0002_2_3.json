I seem to be getting more questions whenever I pull up in my hybrid. One data point. 2:53 Why are gas prices often significantly different for the same brand between Prince William and Fairfax Counties and even at different locations within the same county? Zone pricing is trying to do much more than reflect different tax rates. Take a look at the following link : http://www.gasbuddy.com/gb_gastemperaturemap.aspx Assuming the general accuracy of the data underlying the map, differences in do not explain zone pricing. Look at Arizona, for example. There are much higher transportation costs in and around the Grand Canyon and much more competition in the Phoenix market. Yet, Phoenix prices tend to be signficantly higher. Ditto for taxes. From what I quickly found on the Internet, total fuel taxes for the following four states are VA ( 37.7 cents ) ; Utah ( 42.5 cents ) ; NC ( 45.6 cents ) and Montana ( 46.2 cents ) . However, both Montana and Utah have average prices that are significantly lower than either VA or NC. There 's probably less relationship to costs and zone pricing than the oil companies want the public to believe. I had a conversation with a friend the other day who owns an SUV and he is n't worried about the price of gas because he travels less than 10 miles a day .. yes .. it 'll cost more ... so he 'll have to cut back on his gourmet coffee ... two cups rather than three. :-) seriously-it 's about how far folks choose to drive and how folks define phrases like `` I must and have no choice ''. It takes a hard knock for folks to take a hard look at things they always assumed could not change. I predict ... lots of folks will be taking harder looks at whether or not choices are choices or no choice '' is truly no choice. I know it happened during the gas crisis ... and as bad as it is now-this is not as bad as then-though if $ 3 a gallon is in the rear view mirror and $ 4 a gallon on the horizon and coming fast ... we might think so ... .. but I would bet that folks would choose ( there 's that word again ) $ 4 or even $ 5 a gallon rather than waiting in line for 3 hours only to find out the guy in front of you got the last tankful. America 's love affair with the automobile is about to be revisted though I doubt seriously a divorce is anywhere near ... :-) sorry .. my attitude is grin and bear it ... it 's sort of like coffee doubling in price ... my property accessment going up 300% ( which it did ) ... ... and today .. I paid $ 68 bucks to fill up my 89 Ford Van. I got ta talk to Ray Hyde about that Hybrid .... he 's got .. he said if he had to choose .. he 'd keep his truck ... :-) Did I really say that? That would be a tough `` choice ''. With the truck I 'd have some chance of making money, but I 'd hate to have to drive it if it was n't working. If you have to drive, the hybrid is a joy. Dead silent, dirt cheap, reliable, little bit of capital cost detriment, sufficient power. 48 mpg if you drive at 75+ like a maniac. I remember people sniffing at it, saying they would n't do it because the payback on capital was n't there. I drone on about costs and benefits, but a ) that 's not everything, and b ) sometimes circumstances change. I 'm going to have to send a letter to the guv'nor. I have a bunch of vehicles and only use the appropriate one for the task at hand. I need a portable license plate and insurance, otherwise the current `` tax '' plan is going to kill me. I sure hope that those of you who think saving open space and farms will chip in and help out on this : send a letter. I do n't mind paying what it costs to drive or paying what I owe, but this is going to be whacked. I suspect that overhead costs might have something to do with fuel prices. That gas station in Fairfax is sitting on expensive land and paying high taxes. Businesses are `` tax positive '' do n't cha know. If people really do start making different choices, it 's going to be fun to watch real estate prices. BTW 13% more new home sales last year, in spite of higher rates, but prices were down 5k. Time to demand another reassessment. Ray Hyde : Taxes are indeed business overhead that affect retail prices. But I still suggest that zone pricing has more to do with computer software and data-mining than actual costs. posted by <$BlogBacklinkAuthor$> @ <$BlogBacklinkDateTime$>"}
