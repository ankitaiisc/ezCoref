In addition to writing about Theodora Goodman in The Aunts Story, this author also wrote a novel in which the protagonist carries on relationships with Nance Lightfoot and Hero Pavloussis, neither of which last because of Hurtle Duffields immense dedication to his art. In another novel by this author, the title character derives his vision of foreign lands from the landscapes of Sidney Nolan and is accompanied by the poet Frank Le Mesurier.
