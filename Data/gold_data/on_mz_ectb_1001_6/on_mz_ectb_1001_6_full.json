After all, Macau covers an area of just 23 sq. km ( roughly equivalent to the Nankang district of Taipei ) and has a population of 430,000. As Leong Kam Chun says, Macau\" still has the feel of a rural society. \" You bump into the same people all the time in Macau, and if you 're too strict about factions, you only make things difficult for yourself. \" Unlike Hong Kong people, Macau people do n't like to talk politics, \" says Leong. \" They 're more interested in the economy. \" Leong describes himself as belonging to the pragmatic\" making-a-living\" faction. Although pro-Beijing elements prevail in Macau, the former Portuguese administration did n't seem too bothered about PRC pressure when it came to the issue of ties with Taiwan, perhaps because their only concern was for people 's livelihood. Visa-free entry to Macau for Taiwanese is a case in point. Explains Wong Hon Keong :\" Macau offers visa-free access to residents of over 40 countries with which it has consular relations, but Taiwan is the only place for which it provides visa-free access without there being diplomatic ties. \" Moreover, Taiwanese officials have always had an easier time going in and out of Macau, compared with the fuss involved in getting to Hong Kong. For example, P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, visited Macau shortly before the handover, and even figures such as mainland democracy activist Wu'er Kaixi have been admitted to Macau on their way to the mainland-though the mainland authorities of course refused to allow Wu'er to cross into the PRC.", "sentences": [{"docid_partnum": ["mz/sinorama/10/ectb_1001", 6], "tokens":
