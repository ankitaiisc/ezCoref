In his first play Alda competes with Gaea after the death of Loftur, and his last play sees unwanted wealth showered on a pants presser. Besides Short Circuit and Pigeon Banquet, his time in a Luxembourg monastery inspired the novels Under the Holy Mountain and The Great Weaver of Kashmir. This man satirized his nation 's epics in The Happy Warriors and attacked Mormonism in The Fish Can Sing. One novel of this man features Arnas Arnaeus, who is beloved by the protagonist of the section called The Bright Jewel. Other creations of this man include Madam Myri, who sends Finna to care for Rosa 's daughter Asta in a novel seeing the foreclosure of Bjartur 's home.
