Everything seemed smooth and orderly. But the people 's primary concern was whether or not the incoming SAR administration would be capable of tackling difficult problems left behind by the Portuguese, particularly economic recession and declining public order. The three\" localizations\" -of civil administration, the law, and official language-have become a focus of public discussion. Concern has been expressed that responsibility has been passed to local administrators too late, and that they are too young and inexperienced-statistics from the department of civil service reveal that 61% of government officials are 40 or under-to deal effectively with problems facing the newly established SAR. Leong Kam Chun says :\" Hong Kong began nurturing local administrative talent in the mid-1970s, whereas Macau only started doing so ten years later, in the mid-1980s. \" Several problems have already begun to emerge, such as the question of\" legal localization. \" Gary Mei, executive director of the Sino-Latino Foundation of Macau, points out that during their four centuries in Macau the Portuguese never attempted to build up the Portuguese language ability of the local people. Few Chinese have ever mastered Portuguese, and there are not many people who understand both Western law and the Chinese language. This presents enormous difficulties for the localization into Chinese of Macau 's mass of colonial era laws. Due to the chronic dearth of qualified personnel among Macau 's judiciary, much of the work of legal localization depends on experts from the mainland. But according to Gary Mei, \" The socialist law that they are used to on the mainland is out of synch with the capitalist-type law of Macau, in terms both of attitude and spirit. \" But legal professionals who have studied in Taiwan, where legal concepts are closer to those that hold in Macau, can play an important role in this localization process."}
