As Macau University professor Wong Hon Keong says, \" You can get there and back in a day. You catch the first flight to Macau in the morning, stop at the Westin for a coffee and to talk business, head to one of the outlying islands in the afternoon for a round of golf, take a stroll downtown, and return to Taiwan that evening. \" But in spite of the convenience for travelers, ties between the two places have been practically invisible for several decades. What path will the relationship follow now that Macau has returned to China? As you pass through the offices of the Macau government 's directorate of administration you notice the relative youth of the staff, most of whom seem to be in their thirties. Rosa Tam, who heads the recruitment and selection division of the directorate 's human resources department, introduces many of her colleagues with the remark that he or she\" studied in Taiwan too. \" Tam herself graduated from the department of educational psychology at National Taiwan Normal University in 1985, and joined Macau 's department of education in 1987, before eventually moving to the directorate of administration and rising to the post of division chief in just 11 years. Tam is just one of the many Macau civil servants who have studied for degrees in Taiwan. The Macau government 's directorate for administration says that around 200 Macau civil servants have academic qualifications from Taiwan, but according to Taiwan 's representative office in the territory, the figure is closer to 1,000. This may not represent a very large share of Macau 's 17,000 civil servants, but given that many of those who graduated in Taiwan hold senior ranks, it adds something of a\" Taiwan flavor\" to the government of the Macau SAR ( Special Administrative Region ) . In contrast, Taiwan alumni are noticeable by their absence from the SAR government in Hong Kong. At present, the most senior government official to have studied in Taiwan is Ou Wenlong, who graduated in mechanical engineering at National Taiwan University ( NTU ) . Ou is Macau 's secretary for transportation and public works, and has been appointed by Chief Executive Edmund Ho as one of the SAR government 's five administration secretaries. Amid all the hype surrounding Macau 's incorporation under the\" one country two systems\" formula, the sensitive issue of the\" Taiwan connection\" within the Macau government is little discussed. As the clearest example of this connection, Ou Wenlong is one official that many journalists from Taiwan have tried to get an interview with, but their requests have all been turned down on the grounds that the secretary is\" too busy. \" He did nevertheless find time to do an interview with Hong Kong 's Phoenix TV, during which he discoursed freely on the subject of Macau 's development.",
