Later, this novel reveals that Joyce Hammond was killed in Spain, where her brother was fighting the fascists. The title character has a brief affair with Gordon Lowther rather than the one-armed Teddy Lloyd. Miss Mackay hates this novella 's title character, who is revealed to be the inspiration of The Transfiguration of the Commonplace, written by her former student Sister Helena. The title character teaches Rose, Mary, Monica, Eunice, Jenny, and Sandy at the Marcia Blaine School for Girls. For 10 points, name this book about an Edinburgh school teacher by Muriel Spark."}
