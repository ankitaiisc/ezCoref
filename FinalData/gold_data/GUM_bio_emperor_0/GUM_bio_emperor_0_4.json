of San Francisco, California, who in 1859 proclaimed himself\" Norton I, Emperor of the United States\" . He later expanded his pretense by claiming to be\" Protector of Mexico\" as well. Born in England, Norton spent most of his early life in South Africa. After the death of his mother in 1846 and his father in 1848, he sailed west, arriving in San Francisco possibly in November 1849. Norton initially made a living as a businessman, but he lost his fortune investing in Peruvian rice. After he lost a lawsuit in which he tried to void his rice contract, Norton 's public prominence faded. He reemerged in September 1859, laying claim to the position of Emperor of the United States. He had no political power, and his influence extended only so far as he was humored by those around him ; nevertheless, he was treated deferentially in San Francisco, and currency issued in his name was honored in the establishments he frequented. Though some considered him insane or eccentric, citizens of San Francisco celebrated his regal presence and his proclamations, such as his order that the United States Congress be dissolved by force and his numerous decrees calling for a bridge connecting San Francisco to Oakland, and a corresponding tunnel to be built under San Francisco Bay. Long after his death, similar structures were built in the form of the San Francisco \u2013 Oakland Bay Bridge and the Transbay Tube, and there have been campaigns to rename the bridge\" The Emperor Norton Bridge\" . On January 8, 1880, Norton collapsed at the corner of California and Dupont ( now Grant ) streets and died before he could be given medical treatment. Nearly 30,000 people packed the streets of San Francisco to pay him homage at his funeral. Norton has been immortalized as the basis of characters in the literature of writers Mark Twain, Robert Louis Stevenson, Christopher Moore, Morris and Goscinny, Selma Lagerl\u00f6f, and Neil Gaiman. Norton I, Emperor of the United States, photograph, c. 1871 \u2013 72 Declares himself emperor Emperor Joshua Norton, in full military regalia, circa 1880 or earlier By 1859, Norton had become completely disgruntled with what he considered the inadequacies of the legal and political structures of the United States. On September 17, 1859, he took matters into his own hands and distributed letters to the various newspapers in the city, proclaiming himself\" Emperor of these United States\" : At the peremptory request and desire of a large majority of the citizens of these United States, I, Joshua Norton, formerly of Algoa Bay, Cape of Good Hope, and now for the last 9 years and 10 months past of S.F., Cal., declare and proclaim myself Emperor of these U.S. ; and in virtue of the authority thereby in me vested, do hereby order and direct the representatives of the different States of the Union to assemble in Musical Hall, of this city, on the 1st day of Feb. next, then and there to make such alterations in the existing laws of the Union as may ameliorate the evils under which the country is laboring, and thereby cause confidence to exist, both at home and abroad, in our stability and integrity. \u2014 NORTON I, Emperor of the United States. The announcement was first reprinted for humorous effect by the editor of the San Francisco Bulletin. Norton would later add\" Protector of Mexico\" to this title. Thus commenced his unprecedented and whimsical 21-year\" reign\" over America. One of Norton 's undated proclamations In his self-appointed role of emperor, Norton issued numerous decrees on matters of the state. After assuming absolute control over the country, he saw no further need for a legislature, and on October 12, 1859, he issued a decree formally abolishing the United States Congress. In it, Norton observed : ... fraud and corruption prevent a fair and proper expression of the public voice ; that open violation of the laws are constantly occurring, caused by mobs, parties, factions and undue influence of political sects ; that the citizen has not that protection of person and property which he is entitled. Norton ordered all interested parties to assemble at Platt 's Music Hall in San Francisco in February 1860 to\" remedy the evil complained of\" . In an imperial decree the following month, Norton summoned the Army to depose the elected officials of the U.S. Congress : WHEREAS, a body of men calling themselves the National Congress are now in session in Washington City, in violation of our Imperial edict of the 12th of October last, declaring the said Congress abolished ; WHEREAS, it is necessary for the repose of our Empire that the said decree should be strictly complied with ; NOW, THEREFORE, we do hereby Order and Direct Major-General Scott, the Command-in-Chief of our Armies, immediately upon receipt of this, our Decree, to proceed with a suitable force and clear the Halls of Congress."}
