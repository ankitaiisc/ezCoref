They could double their capacity without leaving the premises. Why has n't the company applied to builf new facilities on site? By all means explore for oil and gas in the Atlantic. Jim : Speaking seriously here, many families ( including my own ) have already cut back in every way possible. What then? My office, home and children 's schools are all within a 6 mile radius. Vacations are already a thing of the past. We 've cut back on groceries. I 'd trade the car on a hybrid, but it 's paid for and who can afford a car payment what with mortgage rates being what they are and three kids ... So, I ask seriously, what are average hard-working families to do? Andrea : How about a couple of hundred dollars? If the GA repealed the unnecessary sales tax from last year, then the average citizen would pick up some cash. Or, the GA could actually cut the sales tax and you would keep some more of your money. Check out how much the Republican Senators want you to pay in other, new taxes too-to register your car, etc. Jim : I like the graphic, it takes two arms and two legs to fill up our tank. The only answer to cutting the cost of mobility and access is settlement patterns that require less vehicle travel and support more effecient shared-vehicles when one must resort to any vehicle. That is what an understanding of Jane Jacobs suggested 40 years ago ( not just in `` Life and Death ... but also `` The Economy of ' Cities '. '' Let us, honor Ms. Jacobs 's memory with an understanding of the need for Fundamental Change. EMR JAB-Got ta love it. Yup, a couple of hundred dollars is going to save the day! Jane Jacobs knew the difference between a community and a construction plan. Was n't one of her main arguments that you can not plan everything, and you should allow communities to be what they are and what they become? Did n't she fight Robert Moses because he thought he had too much control over other peoples ' lives? Somehow I doubt she would have gotten on board with fundamental change if it involved massive central and regional planning. Andrea, One option may be telecommuting a couple of days a week. Other than that, here 's the hard truth : There 's not much that average, hard-working families can do in the short run to cope with higher gas prices except hope that their paychecks keep pace with inflation. What you should NOT do is support demagogic political ploys that make problems worse, not better. In the longer run, you can support more pedestrian friendly, transit-friendly development patterns that give you and your family more transportation options. You should support development patterns that allow compatible uses ( houses, small office buildings, small retail shops ) to be located close to each rather than scattered all over. How much money could you save if you could get by with only one car instead of two? What would it mean if you lived in a place where your children could walk to school? Think outside the box. Kingfish, I 'm all in favor of alternate fuels. Converting biomass to ethanol seems to be one that is self-sustaining economically without massive incentives. I 'd favor government-sponsored research to devise technologies that would make ethanol more competitive, but I do n't like the idea of subsidizing specific business enterprises. Once you give them a subsidy, they never let go, no matter how much the world changes around them. Witness the mohair subsidies put into place during World War II. I tend to agree with Jim that markets function best, so long as no one has a finger on the scale. Many believe that zone pricing, which is generally used by oil companies, is inconsistent with our antitrust laws ( Section 13 of the Robinson-Patman Act ) . Others disagree. Does zone pricing constitute a finger on the scale? If so, should the GA outlaw zone pricing? Toomanytaxes : Zone pricing is the mechanism the oil companies use to make sure that we pay the same price as people in states with higher gas taxes. Only, we pay the extra few cents per gallon to them rather than into our state transportation accounts. Considering the wide variety in local and state fuel taxes the near uniformity of the pump price across state lines is ... curious. I was recently on the webpage for the Energy Information Agency and their cost of fuel adjusted for inflation chart demonstates that we have been at $ 3 per gallon measured in 2005 dollars before. It is about the historic peak in real prices, but it is hardly unprecedented, and not worth quite the hype or hysteria it is generating. It is hard to imagine a company or a family that can not improve its efficiency and reduce consumption, and that is not a bad outcome at all."}
