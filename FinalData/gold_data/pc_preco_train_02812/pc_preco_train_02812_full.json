I was so scared. ''  `` They asked me what happened and said they might be able to get the car running again. I sat in the car hoping that these men were n't doing something bad. A few minutes later, they started the car. It started right up! They told me the car would be fine but that I should get it checked out. ''  `` And you 'd like me to look at it, right? '' I asked.  `` No, '' the woman went on. `` I was so thankful. I offered them money, but they would n't take it. Then they told me they were former students of yours. ''  `` What? '' I asked in surprise. `` Who were they? ''  `` They did n't tell me. They just gave me your name and the school 's name and made me call to thank you. I hope you know how thankful I am. ''  I did n't know what to say. I always tried to teach students to be honest and other things about life-use what you know to help others.
