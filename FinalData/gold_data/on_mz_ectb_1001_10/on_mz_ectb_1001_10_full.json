And indeed it was Fujianese fishermen who several centuries ago built the first Matsu temple here-the A-Ma-Gau from which Macau takes its name. Ung Choi Kun, deputy chairman of Macau 's Fujian General Chamber of Commerce, says that 100,000 mainlanders have moved to Macau in the past two decades, almost all of them from Fujian Province. At present, around 30,000 people from Macau travel to Taiwan every year for work, many of them ethnic Fujianese taking advantage of family connections to the island. \" When you talk about Matsu and about hometown bonds, it 's not hard finding topics that link Taiwan and Macau, \" remarks Ngan In Leng. \" We have many points in common in the field of academia too, such as Sun Yat-sen and the colonial experience, \" adds Wu Zhiliang, director of the Macau Foundation. In the realm of politics, suggests Wong Hon Keong, Macau can also serve as a\" catalyst and lubricant for relations across the Taiwan Strait. \" The international airport, where flights between Taiwan and the mainland make a stopover, allows for\" one-plane\" travel between the two sides. Also, the continued provision after the handover of visa-free entry for Taiwanese, along with the relative ease with which Taiwan officials can visit the SAR, testifies to Macau 's flexibility in these matters. \" Macau will help to boost cross-strait relations, \" says Wong Hon Keong. But as Tan Zhiqiang points out, nearly a quarter of the residents of Macau have arrived from the mainland during the past ten years. Unlike the British in Hong Kong, the Portuguese colonial administration always tried to minimize conflict with Beijing, promoting compromise and dialogue. As a result there was little\" anti-China\" sentiment among the people of Macau at the time of the handover, in contrast to the pro-democracy mood that swept Hong Kong in 1997. \" When Taiwanese are confronted with Macau 's ' pro-Beijing ' slant, they should try and be more understanding. \" says Tan.", "sentences": [{"docid_partnum": ["mz/sinorama/10/ectb_1001", 10], "tokens": ["Matsu",
