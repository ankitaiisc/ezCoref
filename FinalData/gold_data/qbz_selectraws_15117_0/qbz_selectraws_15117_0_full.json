Prior to selling his land, one man helps another character leave prison, where she was sent after the rumor-mongering of her sister and the Lapp tramp Os-Anders. In this novel, the daughter of the lazy Brede Olson was forced to live with Fru Heyerdahl after she defended her from accusations of infanticide. Babro 's claim that she stumbled in a brook while pregnant, which led to her daughter drowning, does not convince the owner of Maaneland, though he ends up marrying her anyways. Another infanticide resulted after the birth of a daughter with a harelip, though the mother later gives birth to Leopoldine in prison. Sivert is the good son of this novel 's protagonist, and is unlike Eleseus, who leaves the farm Sellanraa for America.
