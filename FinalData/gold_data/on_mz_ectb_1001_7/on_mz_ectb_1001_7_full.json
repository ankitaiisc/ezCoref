Chen arrived in Macau ten years ago, and ran air-tours by light aircraft until the enclave 's international airport opened, after which he moved into the liquor trade. When he travels to the mainland he takes his Macau Resident 's Permit, but when he comes back to Taiwan he uses his ROC passport. As part of his efforts to attract more Taiwanese investors to do business in Macau, he helped introduce President Group CEO Kao Chin-yen to the territory, and in order to build better ties with the mainland Chinese, he helped the Xinhua News Agency in Macau to install satellite TV. But when he found that his elementary-school-age grandson was speaking Cantonese all day he quickly sent him back to school in Taiwan, fearing that the boy was losing his mother tongue. A consensus among the Taiwanese living and working in Macau is that\" you ca n't use ideology to decide what 's right and wrong. \" Another point they agree on is that not enough was done in the past to develop ties between Taiwan and Macau, but that with Macau 's change of status, and the corresponding change in atmosphere, things should be different from now on. Chen Chung-yung points out that rents in Macau are about 25% less than rents in Hong Kong, while Macau 's connections with the European Union means that it enjoys tax concessions and generous trade quotas. \" Taiwanese businesspeople never notice these benefits. All they see is gang violence and assume that law and order has broken down, \" says Chen.
