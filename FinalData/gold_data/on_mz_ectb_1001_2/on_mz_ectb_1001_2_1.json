applied, in line with official procedure, for a press pass to the handover ceremony, but the application was eventually rejected as\" unapproved by the security department. \" On the eve of the handover, the signboard of the Taipei Trade and Tourism Office in Macau was quietly taken down, after the office had been privately warned to remove the sign before the transfer of sovereignty. Office director William Li was subsequently reprimanded by the Mainland Affairs Council for his handling of the affair. None of the above was problems at the time of Hong Kong 's handover in 1997, which goes to show how cautious the Macau SAR government is regarding Taiwan. When senior Macau officials are asked about having studied in Taiwan, they are always quick to add mention of other academic qualifications obtained in Macau, Lisbon, or mainland China. \" It 's called sanitizing your record! \" quips Tan Zhiqiang, Hong Kong and Macau bureau chief for the China Times, who was born and raised in Macau and wrote his doctoral dissertation on\" The Question of Macau 's Sovereignty. \" The more senior a government official is, the more defensive he is likely to be on the subject of his studies in Taiwan. \" It does n't matter where you studied and where you graduated, \" says Chen Mingying, a senior official in the Macau government 's news department. Competence and professionalism are what the government requires from its personnel. Another graduate of a Taiwan institution declares bluntly that he only spent four years in Taiwan getting his degree, and the place had virtually no effect on him at all.
