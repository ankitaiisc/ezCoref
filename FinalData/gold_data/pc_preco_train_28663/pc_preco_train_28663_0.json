And there are some warm reminds for people to travel. They are really great pros. So most people think they are fantastic improvements.  `` In the old days, there were lots of advertisements during the weather report. It seemed advertisements are the most important part. '' an old man said. `` And we could see no people but advertisements. '' added another old woman.  `` When I listened to the weather report, I was afraid to see the advertisements. Those colorful advertisements always made me crazy. So I never watched weather report on TV. '' said a young man.  Now the audience enjoy their favorite songs and enjoy the warm reminds while listening to the weather report. Audience can have more fun with weather report and at the same time with the advertisements, too. That 's a wonderful idea."}
