For a change of pace, I invite you to contemplate the hazard posed by that old computer monitor sitting in your basement or the pre-big screen TV collecting dust in your garage. They contain toxic chemicals -- do n't dump them in the trash! Be responsible and unload them at one of 18 electronics recycling events scheduled in Virginia this April. If landfilled or incinerated, hazardous materials in common electronic products may be released into the soil, air or water. Televisions and computer monitors use cathode ray tubes ( CRTs ) , each of which contain as much as 8 pounds of lead. Flat screen TVs and monitors contain mercury. Printed circuit boards and switches in electronic devices contain small amounts of chromium, cadmium, mercury and lead. '' Almost seventy-five percent of all obsolete electronics are still stored in offices and homes. This is a great opportunity to get rid of that old PC or VCR that has been collecting dust and know it will be responsibly reused or recycled, '' said Computer Recycling Initiative 's Director, Carrie Dorsey. Click here to find a recycling event near you. Good idea. I 'd feel a lot better about it if the stuff did n't wind up going to China and being `` recycled '' in a manner that is environmentally unfriendly. It 's kind of like the Oregon soft drink cans. Turns out they were being ground up and turned into substrate for leaching gold : a pretty nast process. Darn, they are n't hitting Spotsy. I 've got two dead monitors taking up space in my office. Jim, on behalf of the Virginia Recycling Markets Development Council and the Mid-Atlantic Consortium of Recycling and Economic Development Officials ( MACREDO ) , thanks for plugging e-cycling. Such events are becoming more frequent and more convenient to more Virginia residents, although based on cod 's comment, we still have a ways to go. A well-used economic development tool is the incubator, typically an office building that is subdivided and provides subsidized rent and admin services to small business that have outgrown their garage or bedroom, but are too small for leased space. These incubators typically cater to high tech or `` clean '' service businesses. I have always thought we should consider setting up recycling `` incubators '' at landfills and transfer stations. E-waste and construction waste are two potentially profitable steams and nurturing small recycling businesses might serve both an economic development good and a public good. A person with a pick-up truck could start such a business pretty easily. The cost of a trailer or two and a covered space would probably be much less than equivalent office space. If we stimulated home-grown markets, we might not send so much to China, although I suppose anything we can do to curb the trade deficit might be considered a good thing in some quarters. That 's right. I know a guy who gets surplus building materials sorts and resells it. I 've bought quite a bit from him and he apparently does a good business. The business itself is somewhat trashy looking. It appears that it is located on part of an old family farm, and the nearby houses are ones that have been spun off to family memebers. But if anybody else tried to duplicate it, I ca n't think of anyplace in my county where it would be allowed, or else the requirements would be so onerous it could n't survive. In my home town, they once built an entire tanker truck for the fire department, out of stuff that came from the dump. We had really low taxes. The dump had well organized recycling areas located around the central landfill pit, and people had a good eye for things that others might want. Recycling is a really good idea, but it is hard to make it pay, and it has a waste stream of its own. What we need to do is to move the recycling process forward into the repair world. The Volkswagen Beetle was a terrible car, but it was eminently recyclable. I had one for almost twenty years and at the end there was n't a single part that was original. The entire body had been swapped out, the machinery several times, and the running gear many times. It was still running when I sold it, but if VDOT ever checked the serial numbers, I do n't know what would happen. The other thing we need to do is expand the deposit idea. In addition to having deposits on soft drink bottles, we should have them on appliances, autos and other big ticket items where they can do some good. The deposit would flow to the recycler who is the final user : this would make recycling profitable. He would claim the refund from the manufacturer. This would ensure that the user of a product pays for its disposal, and manufacturers would have an incentive to keep the deposit money as long as possible by building items that can be repaired rather than disposed of. In the case of foreign manufacturers, the recycling fee would haqve a similar effect as an import duty and could be collected in the same way, but without being called a tariff. Why do some localities charge for the service while others do n't? Just curious. Because, for the most part, it is a money losing operation, or at most marginal."}
