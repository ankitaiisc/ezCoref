Another character in this work, a monkey-like woman, talks about a merchant who chopped up snakes and sold the pieces as dried fish. That woman inspires 60% fear and 40% curiosity in the only other character of the story, a lowly servant with a prominent, pus-filled pimple on his right cheek. This work sees that woman explains to the servant that it is not wrong for her pluck the hair of dead corpses to make wigs because she needs to survive. Ultimately, the servant uses the same logic to strip the woman of her kimono in this short story.
