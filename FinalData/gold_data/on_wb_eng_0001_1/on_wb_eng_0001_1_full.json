{"docid_partnum": ["wb/eng/00/eng_0001", 1], "doc_string": "Recall the story of mandatory newspaper recycling in the District. As a political city, they created so much waste product they flooded the market. If you want to look down the road, think about what is going to happen after we spend a few billion to meet the Chesapeake Bay waste water restrictions. Where are we going to put all the sludge that results? Once we stop putting it in the Bay, we are going to have to put it on the land. Then we will have regulations to prevent sludge runoff in order that we do n't pay for the same sludge creation multiple times. Eventually we will outlaw gravity so that sludge is prohibited from running downhill. Coming soon to a farm near you : two month 's worth of stench. As an engineer and a flinty New Englander, and a farmer, I spend a lot of time fixing old junk. I ca n't stand throwing something away. Maybe some of it comes from growing up on an island where there was no place to throw it. My father used to say that garbage was like scotch tape. ( Shaking his thumb with an imaginary loop of tape on it. ) `` You ca n't throw it away, you can only stick it someplace else. '' When I 'm repairing something that was designed so it ca n't be fixed, it makes me crazy. I want to go find some enginner and marketing guy an knock heads together. Here are a few examples. A rototiller with gears made out of free machining brass. Guaranteed to fail. A windshiel wiper motor installed in a totally inaccessible place under the dash. It was installed by compressing four little rubber studs into holes in the sheet metal, and sealed with a ten inch oblong flat gasket. When the rubber studs rotted away, the motor fell on the floor, followed by a torrent of rain that shorted out everything under the dash. A 1/4 inch diameter spring loaded shift lever detent that you had to break the tractor in half to replace. Every piece of household plumbing and wiring I ever had to fish through a hollow wall. Anything that can only be repaired upside down. A twelve bolt circle on a transmission housing with six hex head bolts and six star pattern bolts. Try and figure that out in the dark under the car. The ignitor for the gas range that costs 25% of what the range cost. What 's worse is, that because I 'm good at this, people think I like it. Wrong. I hate things and I love flesh. I 'm convinced that things are inhabited with Gremlins. It 's a vicious circle. The more stuff you have the more stuff you need to maintain it, like the Virginia Highways. It starts with a screwdriver, and next thing you know it 's a shopfull of air compressors, saws, welders, a forklift, an earthmover, a dump truck to haul the earthmover ..... My wife takes great glee in making fun of all of this. Then I pointed out all he special purpose tools in her kithchen, and that is just for one job. She carefuly forgets all that when she needs something and it turns out that I have just the right framitz to manufacture a repair piece for her thing-a-bob. I 'm convinced that we could solve our balance of payments deficits if we just passed must be repairable laws. Every engineer should be required to be a mechanic for ten years. For many of us our life has come down to buy it at Wal-mart and take it to the dump. Even if you buy it at the BMW or John Deere dealer it is no different. So, if PEC wants to make a supporter out of me, the way to do it is to start a campaign that ensures things do n't have to be thrown away, not one to recycle them at a loss. I work for E-Tech Recycling Inc ( http://www.etechrecycling.com ) , an electronics recycling company located in Virginia. We recycle all types of electronics items such as computers, monitors, TVs etc. When I speak with people about the importance of recycling electronic items, they are very ignorant. I think more than anything, we need to educate people about the importance of recycling. posted by <$BlogBacklinkAuthor$> @ <$BlogBacklinkDateTime$>", "sentences": [{"docid_partnum":
