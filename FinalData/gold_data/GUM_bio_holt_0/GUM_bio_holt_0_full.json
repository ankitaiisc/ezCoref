He also led the Owls with 67 runs scored and shared the team lead with 11 stolen bases. In the same season, he was named both to the All-NCAA Regional Team and the All-Silver Glove Trophy Series team. [ 6 ] Holt was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates with the club 's ninth round selection in the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft, one pick before his Rice teammate Ryan Berry. [ 7 ] Professional career Minor leagues Holt began his professional career with the Pittsburgh Pirates ' short season, Class-A affiliate, the State College Spikes, before advancing to the High-A Bradenton Marauders in 2010. His 2010 season was cut short due to injury to his medial collateral ligament, which required surgery. [ 8 ] He began the 2011 season with the Pirates ' Double-A affiliate, the Altoona Curve. On July 13, 2011, Holt was named the MVP of the Eastern League All-Star Game after hitting a two-run homer in the ninth inning.

On May 31, 2014, against the Tampa Bay Rays at Fenway Park, Holt hit his first Major League home run. On June 8, 2014, in order to allow Xander Bogaerts to play 3rd base, Holt moved to left field.

On July 9, 2014, against the Chicago White Sox, Holt drove in Daniel Nava in the bottom of the 9th inning for the first walk-off hit of his career. [ 13 ] On June 1, 2015, while starting at first base for the first time in his career, Holt went 4-for-4 with four doubles, a walk, and two RBI against the Tampa Bay Rays to win 4 to 0.
