While this work acknowledges the soundness of the arguments that use the example of the ancients, its author refuses to reply to them, adding that we are constructing no system here we are a historian, not a critic. This work claims that the age of the epic draws near its end, before outlining how Christianity leads poetry to the truth, and argues that the perfect combination of the grotesque and the sublime is to be found in Shakespeare. This work opens by claiming that the drama contained in the following pages has nothing to commend it to the good will of the public, and associates the grotesque with the new form of comedy, which this work claims is what distinguishes romantic from classical literature. For 10 points, identify this 1827 essay, a manifesto of the new French drama by Victor Hugo which was meant to precede Hugos play about a British Lord Protector.", "sentences": [{"docid_partnum": ["selectraws/12", 0], "tokens": ["At", "the", "end", "of", "this", "work", ",", "its", "author", "notes", "that", "he", "has", "been", "reluctant", "to", "cite", "authorities", ",", "preferring", "reasons", "to", "them", ",", "but", "nevertheless", "provides", "quotes", "from", "Aristotle", "and", "Boileau", "to", "support", "his", "position", "."], "mentions": [[1, [4, 6]], [1, [7, 8]], [3, [7, 9]], [3, [11, 12]], [6, [29, 30]], [7, [31, 32]], [3, [34, 35]]], "sent_string": "At the end of this work, its author notes that he has been reluctant to cite authorities, preferring reasons to them, but nevertheless provides quotes from Aristotle and Boileau to support his position.", "mentions_string": {"this work": [1, [4, 6]], "its": [1, [7, 8]], "its author": [3, [7, 9]], "he": [3, [11, 12]], "Aristotle": [6, [29, 30]], "Boileau": [7, [31, 32]], "his": [3, [34, 35]]}}, {"docid_partnum": ["selectraws/12", 0], "tokens": ["While", "this", "work", "acknowledges", "the", "soundness", "of", "the", "arguments", "that", "use", "the", "example", "of", "the", "ancients", ",", "its", "author", "refuses", "to", "reply", "to", "them", ",", "adding", "that", "we", "are", "constructing", "no", "system", "here", "we", "are", "a", "historian", ",", "not", "a", "critic", "."], "mentions": [[1, [1, 3]], [9, [14, 16]], [1, [17, 18]], [3, [17, 19]]], "sent_string": "While this work acknowledges the soundness of the arguments that use the example of the ancients, its author refuses to reply to them, adding that we are constructing no system here we are a historian, not a critic.", "mentions_string": {"this work": [1, [1, 3]], "the ancients": [9, [14, 16]], "its": [1, [17, 18]], "its author": [3, [17, 19]]}}, {"docid_partnum": ["selectraws/12", 0], "tokens": ["This", "work", "claims", "that", "the", "age", "of", "the", "epic", "draws", "near", "its", "end", ",", "before", "outlining", "how", "Christianity", "leads", "poetry", "to", "the", "truth", ",", "and", "argues", "that", "the", "perfect", "combination", "of", "the", "grotesque", "and", "the", "sublime", "is", "to", "be", "found", "in", "Shakespeare", "."], "mentions": [[1, [0, 2]], [8, [41, 42]]], "sent_string": "This work claims that the age of the epic draws near its end, before outlining how Christianity leads poetry to the truth, and argues that the perfect combination of the grotesque and the sublime is to be found in Shakespeare.", "mentions_string": {"This work": [1, [0, 2]], "Shakespeare": [8, [41, 42]]}}, {"docid_partnum": ["selectraws/12", 0], "tokens": ["This", "work", "opens", "by", "claiming", "that", "the", "drama", "contained", "in", "the", "following", "pages", "has", "nothing", "to", "commend", "it", "to", "the", "good", "will", "of", "the", "public", ",", "and", "associates", "the", "grotesque", "with", "the", "new", "form", "of", "comedy", ",", "which", "this", "work", "claims", "is", "what", "distinguishes", "romantic", "from", "classical", "literature", "."], "mentions": [[1, [0, 2]], [2, [6, 13]], [2, [17, 18]], [1, [38, 40]]], "sent_string": "This work opens by claiming that the drama contained in the following pages has nothing to commend it to the good will of the public, and associates the grotesque with the new form of comedy, which this work claims is what distinguishes romantic from classical literature.", "mentions_string": {"This work": [1, [0, 2]], "the drama contained in the following pages": [2, [6, 13]], "it": [2, [17, 18]], "this work": [1, [38, 40]]}}, {"docid_partnum": ["selectraws/12", 0], "tokens": ["For", "10", "points", ",", "identify", "this", "1827", "essay", ",", "a", "manifesto", "of", "the", "new", "French", "drama", "by", "Victor", "Hugo", "which", "was", "meant", "to", "precede", "Hugos", "play", "about", "a", "British", "Lord", "Protector", "."], "mentions": [[1, [4, 8]], [1, [9, 19]], [2, [12, 19]], [3, [17, 19]], [3, [24, 25]], [5, [27, 31]], [4, [24, 31]]], "sent_string": "For 10 points, identify this 1827 essay, a manifesto of the new French drama by Victor Hugo which was meant to precede Hugos play about a British Lord Protector.", "mentions_string": {"identify this 1827 essay": [1, [4, 8]], "a manifesto of the new French drama by Victor Hugo": [1, [9, 19]], "the new French drama by Victor Hugo": [2, [12, 19]], "Victor Hugo": [3, [17, 19]], "Hugos": [3, [24, 25]], "a British Lord Protector": [5, [27, 31]], "Hugos play about a British Lord Protector": [4, [24, 31]]}}]}
