Around 1,000 of Macau 's civil servants have studied in Taiwan, and every year some 30,000 people travel from Macau to Taiwan for business or work, along with more than 400 students. But against the backdrop of continued proclamations from the PRC about how\" Macau 's ' one country two systems ' arrangement sets an example for solving the Taiwan problem, \" these figures, along with the Taiwan-Macau exchanges that they represent, have been willfully neglected by Macau 's mainstream media. Macau and Taiwan : so near and yet so far. What are the connections that bind these two places, and what are the opportunities for new developments in the wake of the 1999 handover? On December 19, 1999, the eve of Macau 's transfer of sovereignty, the China Times in Taiwan published a survey on the Taiwanese public 's views about Macau 's return to Chinese control. According to the survey, 31% of people in Taiwan were n't even aware that Macau was about to be handed back to China, while 53% answered that they did n't know whether the handover would be beneficial or harmful for Macau 's development. But when asked whether the\" one country two systems\" formula, as used for Hong Kong and Macau, was acceptable for Taiwan, 59% responded\" No, \" while 27% said that they did n't know. As these results clearly indicate, the people of Taiwan still know little about Macau, in spite of existing exchanges, and more than half of them flatly reject Beijing 's\" one country two systems\" formula-so readily taken up in Macau-as a solution to the Taiwan question."}
