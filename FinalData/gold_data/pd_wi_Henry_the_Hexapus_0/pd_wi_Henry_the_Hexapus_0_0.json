His name comes from the fact that it alliterates well with \"hexapus\" and also from King Henry VIII, who had six wives. Henry was found off the coast of North Wales in a lobster pot, and is in captivity at the Blackpool Sea Life Centre in North West England. Henry 's unusual number of arms was not immediately noticed, and experts believe that the Hexapus came about due to a birth defect, rather than a physical accident. Developmental biologist PZ Myers calls the defect\" an ordinary sort of error. \" After being taken from the sea, he was transferred to the Anglesey Sea Zoo, which, in turn, donated him to the Blackpool Centre. Henry is going to be in a new exhibit with an octopus at the Blackpool Sea Life Centre, entitled\" Suckers\" . An aquarium spokeswoman has stated that\" [ Henry ] 's a lovely little thing. \" Similar birth defects have been recorded in the past, including a 10-armed Octopus briareus and one with a forked arm tip."}
