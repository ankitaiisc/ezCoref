This is the official repository for our preprint, [ezCoref: Towards unifying annotation guidelines for coreference resolution](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-eacl.24/). ezCoref is an annoation methodology for coreference resolution, comprising of a crowdsourcing-friendly annotation tool and an interative tutorial. ezCoref has been validated on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

This repository contains code for launching ezCoref (Tool and Tutorial) and crowdsourced annotations collected via ezCoref.

Try out a demo of [ezCoref tutorial](http://azkaban.cs.umass.edu:8876/tutorial) and annotating a portion of ["Alice in Wonderland"](http://azkaban.cs.umass.edu:8876/passage/?debugDoc=lb_11_alices_adventures_in_wonderland_brat_0&debugChunk=lb_11_alices_adventures_in_wonderland_brat_0_2) using ezCoref.

**Update (May 2023)**: Code for tool and annotated data are now available. Apologies for the delay.

**Update (Feb 2023)**: Demo of the tool and tutorial are now available.
